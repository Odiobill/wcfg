Simple management of LAMP-like virtual servers for Debian and derivates

This script is intended to be run as super user, since it will configure (or
remove) complete LAMP-like virtual servers. It can manage many different things
like multiple website configurations for nginx or apache2, mysql databases and
privileges, (ftp) users, awstats, logrotate. It provides also advanced website
backup features.
