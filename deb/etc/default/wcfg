# WSSKELDIR is a template directory that at least should contain three subdirs:
# awstats, htdocs and logs. It's content will be copied in the home directory
# of the new user.
# If you need to clone a different source directory, just replace this value.
#
WSSKELDIR="/etc/wcfg/wsroot"

# An nginx virtual site configuration template is distribuited with wcfg: it
# will be filled with the website parameters and stored in the directory
# specified by NGINXDIR. If you want to use a different template, just replace
# the NGINXDOM value.
#
NGINXDOM="/etc/wcfg/nginx/site"

# An apache2 virtual site configuration template is distribuited with wcfg: it
# will be filled with the website parameters and stored in the directory
# specified by APACHEDIR. If you want to use a different template, just replace
# the APACHEDOM value.
#
APACHEDOM="/etc/wcfg/apache2/site"

# WSROOTDIR should be the same for every of your websites, and the Debian
# default location /var/www/ is used by default. If you need a different root
# directory, just replace WSROOTDIR value.
#
WSROOTDIR="/var/www"

# How many snapshots do you want to preserve online? Every (daily) snapshot
# contains a copy of the htdocs directory and (if available) a database dump.
# Please consider that files inside htdocs are not copied, but referred using
# real links from the last available snapshot: you will not waste disk space
# for files that were not modify.
# You may also customize the snapshots number using per-site values within every
# specific site configuration file.

SNAPSHOTS=7


# The following parameters should work fine on every Debian/Ubuntu installation.
# You should not touch them unless you know exactly what you are doing.

# If you want to use an external/custom MySQL server that you can't connect to
# using the preconfigured debian-sys-maint administrative user, then you need to
# provide the suitable connection string in the following format:
#
# MYSQLCSTR="-u root -pPasswordForTheDataBaseServer -h sql.example.org"

# By default, every created (ftp) user shares the same user id, that is set to
# the same of the www-data user. If you need a different user id, just replace
# WWWUID value, that is set to 33 as default in Debian systems.
#
WWWUID=33

# By default, every created (ftp) user shares the same group id, that is set to
# the same of the www-data user. If you need a different group id, just replace
# WWWGID value, that is set to 33 as default in Debian systems.
#
WWWGID=33

# Debian usually puts every nginx site definitions using different files in
# that specific directory. If you are using a custom nginx configuration,
# different from the Debian default, replace NGINXDIR with a suitable value
# for your sites-available directory.
#
NGINXDIR="/etc/nginx/sites-available"

# Debian usually puts every apache2 site definitions using different files in
# that specific directory. If you are using a custom apache2 configuration,
# different from the Debian default, replace APACHEDIR with a suitable value
# for your sites-available directory.
#
APACHEDIR="/etc/apache2/sites-available"

# Debian usually puts every awstats domain configuration using different files
# in that specific directory. If you are using a custom awstats configuration,
# different from the Debian default, replace AWSTATDIR with a suitable value
# for your awstats configuration directory.
#
AWSTATDIR="/etc/awstats"

# An awstats configuration template is not distribuited with wcfg: this
# script will read the original awstats configuration and generate a new one
# using the website parameters, that will be stored in the directory specified
# by AWSTATDIR, too. If you want to use a different template, just replace the
# AWSTATDOM value.
#
AWSTATDOM="/etc/awstats/awstats.conf"

# STATCACHE should be the same for every of your websites, and the Debian
# default location /var/cache/awstats is used by default. However, due to the
# use of symlinks, static reports will actually be stored within the virtual
# server location, in "awstats/reports". If you need to use a different
# directory for awstats static reports, you can update this value.
#
STATCACHE="/var/cache/awstats"

# LENUSER defines the maximum string lenght that a (guessed) user name can have.
# It is by default set to 16 because that is the maximum string lenght that
# MySQL can handle without any complain for its users.

LENUSER=16
