	<h3>Welcome to the Wcfg project page.</h3>
<p><em>Wcfg</em> is mainly a shell script that can configure (or remove) complete LAMP-like virtual servers.
It can manage many different things, like <strong>nginx</strong> or <strong>apache2</strong>
<em>NameVirtualServers</em>, <strong>mysql</strong> databases and privileges, (ftp) <strong>users</strong>,
<strong>awstats</strong> static reports. <strong>logrotate</strong> will also be configured to take care of
your virtual servers, but everything is keep consistent with the regulations and automatisms provided by the
standard Debian packages.</p>
<p>An <em>FTP server is not required</em>, however a new user will be created for every virtual server, with
the website root path as home directory.</p>
<p>Removing a virtual server will clean everything, but a complete backup is dumped in the current directory
before leaving.</p>

	<h3>Website backups</h3>
<p><em>Wcfg</em> also provides advanced website backup feature using <strong>rsync</strong> real-link
snapshots, so you won't waste disk space except for the only filesthat were modified since last backup, plus
an updated database dump (if a database is used by that specific website, of course).</p>
<p>If a forth directory called <em>backup</em> exists under the website main tree, the
<strong>wcfg-backup</strong> script (it usually runs from a daily cron job) will take snapshots as explained
above. You can choose to exclude files or directories from your daily snapshots listing them in a file named
<em>exclude</em> under the backup directory. You must specify relative paths starting from the website root
directory, like:</p>
<pre><code>htdocs/uploads/tmp</code></pre>
<p>If you use views for any of your database, please provide the <em>show view</em> grant to the
<em>debian-sys-maint</em> user with the following SQL commands after loggin into MySQL as admin user:</p>
<pre><code>	use mysql;
	update user set Show_view_priv = "Y" where User = 'debian-sys-maint';
	flush privileges;
</code></pre>
